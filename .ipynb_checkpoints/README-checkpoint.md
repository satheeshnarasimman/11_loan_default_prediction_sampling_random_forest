# week11_machine_learning_project

## Resampling
- Resample data, build and evaluate logistic regression classifiers
- Oversample: Naive Random Oversampler and SMOTE
- Undersample: Cluster Centroids
- Over and undersample: SMOTEENN

---For each of the above:
   - Train logistic regression classifier
   - Calculate balanced accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
   - Imbalanced classn report
   
## Ensemble learning
Train and compare 2 ensemble classifiers. BRFC and Easy Ensemble classifier
- Load, split into Train and Test
- Train the model using quarterly data
- Balanced accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report
- BRFC: Feature importance
